    <div><h1>OUR BEGINNINGS</h1></div>

    <div><img src="images/Strawberries .jpg" alt="strawberries"></div>

    <div>
        Yeti Redi is a small family-owned business based in St. George, Utah, specializing in freeze-dried foods. Our journey began when we, along with our six little Yetis, were searching for convenient and nutritious food options for our family's outdoor adventures. We found that the available options in the market were either bland or didn't meet all of our requirements.
    </div>

    <div>
        Determined to provide a better alternative, we decided to start our own business in the industry. We wanted to offer high-quality freeze-dried foods that not only tasted great but also provided the necessary nutrients for our bodies during outdoor activities. We believed that the industry leaders were not offering everything the consumer wanted, and we saw an opportunity to make a difference.

    <div>
        We started by freeze-drying our own homemade meals and snacks, experimenting with different recipes until we found the perfect balance of flavor and nutrition. Our little Yetis were our taste testers, and they loved the variety of foods we were making.
        <break>
        We began selling our products at local events and farmers' markets in St. George, Utah. People loved our freeze-dried meals and snacks and were amazed by their quality and taste. We received excellent feedback and started to build a loyal customer base.
    </div>


    <div>
        As our business grew, we expanded our product line to cater to different outdoor activities, such as hiking, camping, fishing, and more. We also started educating people about the benefits of freeze-dried foods and how they could make their outdoor adventures more enjoyable and convenient.
    </div>

    <div>
        Today, Yeti Redi continues to thrive, thanks to the support of our loyal customers and the hard work of our dedicated team. We still make all of our meals and snacks in small batches, using only the best ingredients and the latest technology to preserve their quality and taste. Our goal is to make healthy and delicious food accessible to everyone, and we are proud to be a part of the freeze-dried food industry.
